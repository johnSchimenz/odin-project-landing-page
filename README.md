# odin-project-landing-page

This project is about building a website template for one of the assigned Odin Projects.  Once finished, the skills I will have demonstrated include:

    Use flexbox to format website

    Use CSS to format HTML

    Have a baseline for my own website, where I will host my coading projects to get a job
